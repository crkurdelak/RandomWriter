They said a human wearing a striped shirt will come through. I heard that they hate spiders. I heard that they love to stomp on them. I heard that they like to tear their legs off. However... ...that can't be true, can it? Ahuhuhu... You donated so much money to us. All the spiders want you to know how thankful they are! We're in your debt, dearie~ Ahuhuhuhu... Did you hear what they just said? They said a human wearing a striped shirt will come through. I heard that they hate spiders. I heard that they love to stomp on them. I heard that they like to tear their legs off. I heard... ... that they're awfully stingy with their money. Ahuhuhuhu... You think your taste is too refined for our pastries, don't you, deary? Ahuhuhu... I disagree with that notion. I think your taste... Is exactly what this next batch needs! I heard... ...a certain stingy human hates spiders. Muffet traps you! If she invites you to her parlor, excuse yourself. Don't look so blue, my deary~ ...I think purple is a better look on you! Ahuhuhu~ You're trapped in a strange purple web! You struggle to escape the web. Muffet covers her mouth and giggles at you. You struggle to escape the web. Muffet laughs and claps her hands. You struggle to escape the web. Muffet is so amused by your antics that she gives you a discount! You struggle to escape the web. Nothing happened. Why so pale? You should be proud~ Proud that you're going to make a delicious cake~ Ahuhuhu~ Let you go? Don't be silly~ Your SOUL is going to make every spider very happy~~ All the spiders clap along to the music. Muffet does a synchronized dance with the other spiders. Oh, how rude of me! I almost forgot to introduce you to my pet~ It's breakfast time, isn't it? Have fun, you two~ The person who warned us about you... Offered us a LOT of money for your SOUL. They had such a sweet smile~ and... Ahuhuhu~ It's strange, but I swore I saw them in the shadows... Changing shape...? Oh, it's lunch time, isn't it? And I forgot to feed my pet~ Muffet tidies up the web around you. Muffet pours you a cup of spiders. Smells like freshly baked cobwebs. With that money, the spider clans can finally be reunited~ You haven't heard? Spiders have been trapped in the RUINS for generations! Even if they go under the door, Snowdin's fatal cold is impassable alone. But with the money from your SOUL, we'll be able to rent them a heated limo~ And with all of the leftovers...? We could have a nice vacation~ Or even build a spider baseball field~ But enough of that... It's time for dinner, isn't it? Ahuhuhu~ You're still alive? Ahuhuhu~ Oh, my pet~ Looks like it's time for dessert~ Huh? Where did you get that...? Did you steal it? Oh, my pet~ It's time to show them what we do with thieves~ Huh? A telegram from the spiders in the RUINS? What? They're saying that they saw you, and... ... you're a total spider fanatic! Oh my, this has all been a big misunderstanding~ I thought you were someone that hated spiders~ The person who asked for that SOUL... They must have meant a DIFFERENT human in a striped shirt~ Sorry for all the trouble~ Ahuhuhu~ I'll make it up to you~ You can come back here any time... And, for no charge at all... I'll wrap you up and let you play with my pet again! Ahuhuhuhuhuhu~ Just kidding~ I'll SPARE you now~ Muffet is sparing you. Ahuhuhu~ What are you doing~ It's time to go~ Feeling comfortable trapped in that web? Ahuhuhuhu~ Well, I don't mind keeping you here~ If you don't mind being gobbled up~ Ahuhuhu~ Just kidding, of course~ ... well... maybe ONE little nibble~ No, no, it's time to go~ ... Ahuhuhuhu... That was fun! See you again, dearie!
